                    I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer from Mexico City ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½. I'm looking for getting recruited 
                    at a company or getting into custom projects for clients. Also, I like to be working on
                    my own projects either for fun or to give something a try.

                    You can find me on <a href="#">Twitter</a> and <a href="#">Linkedin</a>. If you'd 
                    like, you can see some of my projects more in depth -including this one- on my
                    <a href="#">Github</a>.

            <p class="about-p">
                Iâ€™m a 22-year-old student of Innovation Engineering -at Monterrey Institute of Technology and 
                Higher Education- interested in Software Development. Iâ€™m from Mexico City and I like working 
                on my own projects and having fun when coming up with new ideas to code. Iâ€™m currently skilled 
                at general web development, which includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Git. Currently Iâ€™m developing 
                some projects, including this one while still learning at the coding bootcamp Iâ€™m attending.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of my hobbies are working out, playing the guitar, drawing, going out with friends and playing 
                video games. Iâ€™m also interested in blockchain, specifically into NFTs (non fungible tokens). Iâ€™m working 
                with an associate on the launch of our own catalog and environment, which has a website that Iâ€™m working 
                on. Hopefully the project is able to scale upwards.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Iâ€™d like to start to write some articles for the page. Which would be a place where I can throw any idea 
                that comes to my mind, which can be a huge mischief.
